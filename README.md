# research_and_analysis

## Description

This repo is a collection of some research and analysis essays I have written over the past few years. Some of the essays in this repo were written for courses at college and others were written in my free time. 

The topics addressed in a select few of these pieces, namely [*Tyranny of the Minority*](tyranny-of-the-minority.pdf) and [*Disorder: Peace Through Strength*](disorder-peace_through_strength) are inherently political; these two essays in particular were written for a course in International and Global Studies and do not necessarily reflect my political views. None of these essays are intended to do that. Instead, these pieces are meant to show my understanding of complex topics, critical thinking, and research abilities (you'll notice that in these two essays in particular, I take opposing political stances in the conventional sense). I also just enjoy writing them. 

## Quick Summaries 

**Disorder: Peace Through Strength**

This essay was written for a seminar in International and Global Studies at WPI. The topic was to address the concerns outlined in the book *Disorder* by Helen Thompson. Throughout the essay, I argue that the United States must maintain its powerful presence on the world stage. I pull from previous journal articles, scholarly pieces, and news sources to analyze the impacts of the concept of deterrance to explain how the United States should act to maintain, or in many places restore restore, peace around the globe.

**Insider Threats**

*Insider Threats* is an informative piece I wrote in my free time to outline the risks of insider threats in an organization. I walk through mitigating insider threats, including the principles of least privilege and zero trust, and describe how organizations can protect themselves from this trend of threats. 

**NVDIA Randomware Incident**


**Russia Ukraine (Apr. 2023)**


**International Law Implications in Cyberspace**


**International Concerns and Solutions to Computer and Network Security (Cyberwarfare)**
